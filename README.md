Oh no your entire class has fallen into a pool infested with sharks and they are HUNGRY.

## Details

This simple application uses React to take the information of a local array of name objects and prints the name objects to the DOM. The button click then changes a key on a random object to "kill" the person. The person then shows up in a gravestone on the DOM. There are live students, a shark attack button and a graveyard of students!
